Welcome to my homepage! I am a joint Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Physics & Astronomy at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/) and [George Mason University](https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/physics-and-astronomy-department). I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, cold atom physics, and quantum simulation, with special interests in **topological phases of matter** and **non-equilibrium systems** (e.g., systems with Floquet driving, quantum quench, dissipation, non-Hermiticity, etc.). Recent years have witnessed the intriguing interplay between the spatiotemporal control of synthetic systems, interaction, dissipation, and the various degrees of freedom as exemplified by spin-orbit coupling and atomic orbits. Specifically, my research focuses on the following two aspects: (1) Investigating novel quantum dynamical phenomena and developing necessary theoretical frameworks for characterizing the topological/correlated/transport properties of dynamic systems, including the topological classifications of dynamical phases, dynamical quantum phase transition and dynamical anomaly. (2) Exploring the emergence of novel states of matter unique and intrinsic to synthetic systems and their associated quantum simulations.
