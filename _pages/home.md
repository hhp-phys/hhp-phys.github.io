I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, cold atom physics, and quantum simulation, with special interests in **topological phases of matter** and **non-equilibrium systems** (e.g., systems with Floquet driving, quantum quench, dissipation, non-Hermiticity, etc.). Recent years have witnessed the intriguing interplay between the spatiotemporal control of synthetic systems, interaction, dissipation, and the various degrees of freedom as exemplified by spin-orbit coupling and atomic orbits. My research focuses on the following two aspects: (1) Investigating novel quantum dynamical phenomena and developing necessary theoretical/numerical frameworks for characterizing the topological/correlated/transport properties of the dynamical systems; (2) Exploring the emergence of novel quantum states of matter unique and intrinsic to synthetic systems and their associated quantum simulations.
