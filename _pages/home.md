I am a joint Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Physics & Astronomy at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/) and [George Mason University](https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/physics-and-astronomy-department). I will be joining [Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.iop.cas.cn/), Beijing, China, as an Associate Professor starting September 2021. I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, cold atom physics, and quantum simulation, with special interests in **topological phases of matter** and **non-equilibrium systems** (e.g., systems with Floquet driving, quantum quench, dissipation, non-Hermiticity, etc.). Recent years have witnessed the intriguing interplay between the spatiotemporal control of synthetic systems, interaction, dissipation, and the various degrees of freedom as exemplified by spin-orbit coupling and atomic orbits. My research focuses on the following two aspects: (1) Investigating novel quantum dynamical phenomena and developing necessary theoretical/numerical frameworks for characterizing the topological/correlated/transport properties of the dynamical systems; (2) Exploring the emergence of novel quantum states of matter unique and intrinsic to synthetic systems and their associated quantum simulations.
