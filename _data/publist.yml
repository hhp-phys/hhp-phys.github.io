- title: "Exceptional Non-Abelian Topology in Multiband Non-Hermitian Systems"
  image: "NACR.jpg"
  description: Exceptional point (EP) lies at the heart of various intriguing phenomena in optics, acoustics, and other nonconservative systems. We put forward a universal non-Abelian conservation rule governing the collective behaviors of multiple exceptional degeneracies in generic multiband non-Hermitian systems. We uncover two counterintuitive phenomena, including the path-dependent annihilation/coalescence of EPs and forbidden exceptional-line configurations. Our formalism assigns braid-valued invariants to the EPs/ELs as well as paths in the parameter space and sheds light on the versatile manipulations and applications based on exceptional degeneracies in nonconservative systems.

- title: "Dynamical signatures of point-gap Weyl semimetal"
  image: WP.JPG
  description: Weyl semimetal is an archetypical gapless topological phase of matter. Here, we extend WSM to non-Hermitian regime and introduce the so-called point-gap WSM, where a pair of Weyl points are located on the imaginary axis of the complex energy plane (possessing different lifetimes). The generalization triggers a few fundamental changes to the topological characterization and dynamical response of WSMs. We predict a new effect, time-dependent current induced solely by magnetic field, that saturates at long time.

  description: Knots have a twisted history in quantum physics. We demonstrate that knots tied by the eigenenergy strings provide a complete topological classification of one-dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with separable bands. We show the transition between two phases characterized by distinct knots occur through exceptional points and come in two types. We develop an algorithm to construct the corresponding tight-binding non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for any desired knot, and propose a scheme to probe the knot structure via quantum quench.
