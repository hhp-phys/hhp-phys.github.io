- title: "Point-gap Weyl semimetal: dynamical current and boundary-skin modes"
  image: WP.JPG
  description: Weyl semimetal is an archetypical gapless topological phase of matter. Here, we extend WSM to non-Hermitian regime and introduce the so-called point-gap WSM, where a pair of Weyl points are located on the imaginary axis of the complex energy plane (possessing different lifetimes). The generalization triggers a few fundamental changes to the topological characterization and dynamical responseeyl semimetals. We predict a new effect, time-dependent current induced solely by magnetic field, that saturates at long time.

- title: "Knots and Non-Hermitian Bloch Bands"
  image: knot.JPG
  description: Knots have a twisted history in quantum physics. We demonstrate that knots tied by the eigenenergy strings provide a complete topological classification of one-dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with separable bands. We show the transition between two phases characterized by distinct knots occur through exceptional points and come in two types. We develop an algorithm to construct the corresponding tight-binding non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for any desired knot, and propose a scheme to probe the knot structure via quantum quench.

- title: "Topological Invariants for Quantum Quench Dynamics from Unitary Evolution"
  image: DT.JPG
  description: Quench dynamics, time evolution after a sudden change in the Hamiltonian, studied under a new framework yields a collection of topological structures. Here we introduce the key concept of loop unitary constructed from the unitary time-evolution operator and show its homotopy invariant fully characterizes the dynamical topology. This opens up a systematic route to classify and characterize quantum quench dynamics.

  description: We propose a versatile framework to dynamically generate Floquet higher-order topological insulators by multistep driving of topologically trivial Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we introduce dynamical topological invariants from the full unitary return map and show its phase bands contain Weyl singularities whose topological charges form dynamical multipole moments in the Brillouin zone.

  description: We propose to realize a time-reversal invariant topological superfluid by utilizing s-wave pairing and emergent mirror and time-reversal symmetries in two coupled 1D ultracold atomic Fermi gases with spin-orbit coupling. By stacking such systems into 2D, we discover topological and Dirac-nodal superfluids hosting distinct MKP flat bands, which are stable against pairing fluctuations that otherwise annihilate Majorana pairs.

  description: A complete classification of triply degenerate points (semimetals) is given. Based on which, type-II (charge 1) and type-III (charge 0) triply degenerate topological semimetals are predicted. An experimental scheme utilizing spin-tensor- and spin-vector-momentum couplings in cold-atom optical lattice is proposed to realize all the three types of triply degenerate semimetals.

  description: The fundermental task of condensed-matter physics is the search of novel quantum states of matter. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a novel quantum order, dubbed superfluid-quasicrystals. We show the emergent superfluid-quasicrystal stripe state with the minimal fivefold rotational symmetry can be realized as the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate within a practical experimental scheme.
